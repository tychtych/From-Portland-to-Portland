            <p class="intro__text">Need more action and adventure in your life instead of the same old routine? From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some unknown regions of your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England where it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph">ou won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.</p>

So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your adventure.

While it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie, huh?)</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed up by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra eerie time!</p>

Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!</p>
